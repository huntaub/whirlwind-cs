          <h3>About You</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Self-Motivated</li>
            <li>Interested in Computers as a Concept</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            The purpose of this class is to teach you how the computer works, so I am expecting you to be
            excited about the material that we will talk about. Since this is a one credit seminar, you
            will not have to worry about grades as much. However, I do hope that you end up getting something
            out of the course.

            <li>Be accepting.</li>
            <li>Have fun!</li>

          <aside class="notes">
            Computer Science is notorious for not being beginner friendly. I think that this is absolutely horrible,
            and I want everyone in this class to feel welcome regardless of previously experience.

          <h3>Grading and Work</h3>

          <h4>Very little!</h4>

          <aside class="notes">
            The goal of this course is to help students understand the majority of concepts that are used to
            build a computer. It is not supposed to be a burden on your schedule. Therefore, the grades will be
            mostly attendance based. Although, there may be a simple final paper that discusses what portion of the
            computer students would change and why.

          <h3>Textbook</h3>

          <h4>None*</h4>

          <small>* but I will probably post optional readings from around the web</small>

          <aside class="notes">
            Textbooks cost money, simple as that. I will provide any readings that I find useful online. Depending on
            time, they may be optional for interested students. There are several books and other courses that cover
            CS in the same manner as this one, and I will provide you links to them.

            the lifecycle of the device. Now, micro USB (the port on
            your Android phone) is rated for 10000. Compare that to
