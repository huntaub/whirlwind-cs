            In the past few classes, we have been utilizing the
            Logisim program in order to examine simple circuits and
            their behaviors. This page will give you links to the
            files we were using, the program, and instructions on how
            to use it.
          </p>

          <h3>Using the Files</h3>

          <p>
            Each of the provided Logisim files contains
            several <i>Circuits</i> which have the functions that we
            have examined in class. You will see a list of circuits at
            the top part of left pane. You can double click on the
            circuits in order to view and edit them.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is important to note that Logisim has two separate
            modes when working with the circuits files: editing and
            running. In the top left of the program, you will see two
            important icons: one that looks like a hand and one that
            looks like a cursor. <b>In order to toggle the buttons
            (green dots) or clock (green squiggle), you must have
            selected the hand icon in the top left.</b> Similarly, in
            order to edit the circuit (place new gates or wires, you
            must have the cursor selected in the top left.
          </p>

          <p>
            The files each have the following circuits. Be sure to go
            back to the slides to get information about circuits that
            you do not remember.

              <b>chipotle</b> - The circuit that determined whether I
              was eating Chipotle for dinner (or lunch? or
              breakfast...?).
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>pav</b> - The circuit that determined whether the
              number of people in the Five Guys line at the Pav was
              greater than 5.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>encoder</b> - The circuit that tells you which input
              line is "ON".
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>muxer</b> - The circuit that tells you the status of
              one of the input lines.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>half-adder</b> - A circuit that adds two one-bit
              numbers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>full-adder</b> - A circuit that adds two one-bit
              numbers, but allows a carry-over digit to come into the
              calculation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>ripple-carry</b> - A circuit that adds two very large
              numbers (8 bits / 8 wires long) by utilizing a bunch of
              the full-adders.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>sr latch</b> - The first introduction of memory that
              we looked at in class.

          <h4><a href="/logic/state.circ">state.circ</a></h4>

          <p>
            This file contains the simple counters that we talked
            about in the State Lecture.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>simple</b> - A circuit that utilizes a simple
              Flip-Flop. Try changing the value of the flip flop by
              toggling the clock (the squiggly icon).
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>counter</b> - A circuit that counts the number of
              people in line at Five Guys. Remember that the value is
              only updated in memory when the clock is toggled. It
              utilizes our adder, a simple flip flop, and a
              comparator.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>counter3</b> - A circuit that allows the Five Guys
              employees to specify whether they have lots of staff
              today or not. This adds a muxer to the previous circuit.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Creating New Circuits</h3>

          <p>
            Since the purpose of this class is understanding and
            exploration, I encourage interested students to play
            around in Logisim to get a feel for the program and how
            the different components work. You can make a new circuit
            by clicking the green plus icon in the top left of the
            screen. After naming it, you can place components in the
            middle by selecting the right component in the left menu,
            then clicking the area in the workspace to the right to
            place. You can then drag between contacts in order to add
            wiring. Using this method, you can not only place the
            included components (pins, gates, etc.) but also the
            circuits that we have added. Note how the Ripple-Adder
            circuit in the circuits.circ file contains several of the
            full-adders we designed.
