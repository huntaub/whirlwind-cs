            <h3>Should I take this course?</h3>
            <p>
              This course is geared towards motivated non-computing majors who
              fall into the following two categories.
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Students who are interested in Computing majors but want more information
                  about what such a curriculum would consist of. In this sense, this course
                  is meant to be a sampler of the different topics covered in most
                  Computer Science programs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Students who are not interested in Computing majors but want to learn
                  more about how the computers they interact with everyday actually work.
                  This course will provide a simple, bottom-up approach to learning more
                  about computers without having to learn (or know) how to program.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Why is this course important?</h3>
            <p>
              Far too many students come to Universities without an understanding of
              what is included in a Computer Science curriculum. This course is an attempt
              to solve this need without requiring that students learn the minutia of
              programming to appreciate each part of the computer. Additionally, at many
              institutions, there is no class designed for students who are not Computing
              majors but want to learn more about computers without taking basic programming
              courses.
            </p>
            <p>
              This course will attempt to increase interest in computers from students
              in all educational backgrounds.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Why no programming?</h3>
            <p>
              For students in Computing majors, programming is a near-universal requirement
              because of its ability to prepare students for software engineering jobs and
              have total control of the devices that are being studied. While many important
              concepts are communicated effectively through programming (namely abstraction
              and recursion), the extra burden of learning the seemingly arbitrary syntax and
              type rules can reduce the educational value for students who do not plan to
              write software for a living.
            </p>
            <p>
              This course will provide students with an opportunity to quickly get a feeling
              for how computers work at every level without this obstacle.
